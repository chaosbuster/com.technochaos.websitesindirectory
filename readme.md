When viewing profile (one profile) this Extension will convert a profile's website URLs to an associated icon that is clickable to the actual URL.  This Extension is based on Alice Frumin's work to make email addresses and phone numbers clickable in profile directories and on profile view pages.   This extension at this time will only focus on reformatting the Website URLs on the single profile page and NOT the directory listing.

NOTE there are assumptions made on the Website Types and their order in the Profile for the formatting and icons associated with each.  The following website URLs will be recognized and an associated icon will be used.  In the Profile the fields for each of these need to be together consecutively.  It will display in the order in the Profile and the icons will be grouped together in a row.

When using a profile, the email and phone fields will work as in the orginal work of the Directory Links' Extension written by Alice Frumin:
---------------------
  + If an email or phone field is set as "Public Pages" or "Public Pages and Listing"
  + For all email and phone types (home, primary etc.)
  + On the search listings view and when viewing an individual contact record this extension makes:
    + All Emails clickable to email using ``<a href="mailto:___ ">`` regardless of whether one is using a phone or desktop.
    + If viewing on phone: all phone number types clickable to call using ``<a href="tel:___">``
    + If viewing on a desktop phone numbers appear just as plain text
